# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
For this challenge we were hired by an election ofice employee to automate the task of tallying votes in a given election. Writing the code in Python allows the program to be run on any election not just this specific one. For us, the purpose was to learn how to read and write to CSV files and manipulate the data within in order to acheive a desired result; all while using a real world example.
